Crude and Simple python code that uses the lizard library to generate my own CSV files for C source code complexity analysis.

## Overview
I am not a python developer, more of a hack.

The intent of this tool was to play around, learn a little, and make something that would allow me to easily generate my own output from the lizard (https://github.com/terryyin/lizard) tool's complexity analysis.

Ultimately I wanted a method to review complexity of various embedded C modules in order to assist in tasks like Unit Test effort estimation.
